# ChronoMouse: A Handy Clock for Your Cursor
ChronoMouse is a utility designed to simplify time tracking during your digital workflow. It achieves this by displaying a moving clock adjacent to your mouse cursor, ensuring that the current time is always in your field of view.

Here's an image worth admiring:

In addition, ChronoMouse helps monitor your device's battery level, with the time display color switching to red when the battery charge is low.

## Using ChronoMouse
ChronoMouse is user-friendly and easy to integrate into your routine. After launching the application, the current time will begin to appear next to your mouse pointer, moving in tandem with your cursor.

The time display is designed to minimize distractions. It fades out when your mouse is idle and disappears when you're typing. Once you start moving your mouse again, the time display reappears, keeping you aware of the time without breaking your focus.

## Adding ChronoMouse to Startup Items
To have ChronoMouse start automatically upon system startup, add it to your list of startup items. This ensures that ChronoMouse is ready to use as soon as you boot up your device, without needing to manually launch it each time.
